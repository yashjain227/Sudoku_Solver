This project implements a backtracking-based JavaScript Sudoku solver with interactive visualization. 

It allows users:

1.Fetch Sudoku puzzles: Users can request puzzles of different difficulty levels from a publicly available Sudoku API.

2.Visualize puzzles: The retrieved puzzle is displayed as a grid on the web page, with each cell represented as an HTML element.

3.Solve puzzles: Clicking the "Solve Puzzle" button triggers the backtracking algorithm to find a solution, highlighting the solved numbers in the grid.

Features:

1.Backtracking algorithm: Employs the backtracking technique to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.

2.Interactive visualization: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically update the grid, displaying progress during the solving process.

3.API integration: Fetches puzzles from an external Sudoku API, offering various difficulty levels.
